# Regression-Model-Selector
Regression Model Selector

Evaluates different Regression Models by their R squared value and determines the best model to use for the specific dataset.

Regression Models included:
    Multiple Linear Regression
    Polynomial Regression
    Support Vector Regression RBF
    Support Vector Regression Linear
    Support Vector Regression Polynomial
    Decision Tree Regression
    Random Forest Regression


Run the Python file then input the filename of the csv file. It will then process the data with Pandas, NumPy, and scikit-learn and will display the R squared value for each regression model. Afterwards, it will print the name of the model with the highest R squared value.
